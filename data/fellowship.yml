  faqs:
      - question: What cohorts can I apply for?
        answer: Applicants will need to commit 4 months full time to the course from 20th November 2017 to 16 March 2018, and be available to work for a minimum of 1 year starting late March 2018.

      - question: Can I do this remotely?
        answer: No. There will not be the option for remote learning.

      - question: Do I have to be in London?
        answer: To take the full time course, yes you need to be in London. For Ronin you can be anywhere in a +/- 2 hour timezone. However in all circumstances, you will need to have the right to live and work in the UK to gain employment from ThoughtWorks.

      - question: Can I take this part time?
        answer: Unfortunately not. One of the keys to our course is being immersed into a full time coding. We don't offer a part time course at the moment.

      - question: Will I need my own laptop?
        answer: You will need your own laptop for the PreCourse. Makers Academy can provide a machine to use for the full time element of the course.

      - question: What are the dates for applying?
        answer: Applications open on 23rd of October, and close on the 1st of November.

      - question: What are you looking for in a candidate?
        answer: We certainly don’t care about qualifications or job history. We want people with a real interest in coding, people with lots of motivation to become a professional developer. We look for people with good logical reasoning skills, an ability to form mental models, and the ability to deconstruct complex problems. We look for empathetic people who are good communicators and good collaborators. In short - we look for people like you.

      - question: I can't apply now. When will you do this again?
        answer: "That’s a shame. Are you sure? We can’t commit to ever doing this again… We might, but we also might not. Things change, markets change. If you’re serious about becoming a developer, ask yourself: If not now, when?"

      - question: Do I have to be British to apply?
        answer: "Applicants from all nationalities are welcome to apply but must be based in London for the course. In the past, we have offered a free spot at Makers Academy to a refugee who had made it to the UK, who is now successfully employed at a leading company.

      - question: I'm a woman - is this course for me?
        answer: "Over 35% of our graduates have been women: two times higher than industry average."

      - question: I've heard people like me aren't very well represented in the tech community. Should I apply?
        answer: "Yes! We welcome applicants from all backgrounds. We created our own fund to offer Londoners from difficult backgrounds through our training. Our first Fellow was a paintshop worker from Lewisham, who in 2 years has risen to become a tech lead at the Financial Times. Our team have been behind the creation of Muslamic Makers, Black Techies, and Code of Colour, as well as partnering with numerous organisations aimed at improving minority representation in tech."
