In the past we’ve worked with many companies to provide scholarships - from totally open and meritocratic ‘CSR plays’ through to ‘diversity plays’, helping our partners recruit from specific niches. For example, in partnership with ThoughtWorks,we designed a scholarship aimed at women from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds who may not have had the opportunity to enroll at Makers Academy without financial aid. ThoughtWorks sponsored 6 women to do the course. Define your needs and your intended outcome Collaboratively design the scholarship criteria to ensure candidates fit your needs. Landing page built by Makers Academy to promote the scholarship opportunity. Marketing and PR push from both companies to attract  applicants.
