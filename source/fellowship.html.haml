      %h3 What can you expect?
      %p Once you’ve applied, we’ll send you some coding materials by email. You’ll have 48 hours to prepare, and to complete a remote coding test.
      %p Successful candidates will then be invited to a final stage ‘pairing interview’ where we’ll write some more code and assess your cultural fit to join the Makers Academy Agency. The whole process shouldn’t take more than a couple of weeks.

      %h3 Why do this?
      %p As we approach our 5th birthday, and circle our 1500th student, it’s time to start putting our money where our collective mouth is. We’re big believers in doing our bit to improve the diversity of the tech community, but that can sometimes feel a little bit hollow when the course is only accessible to those with £8,000 to spare.
      %p In reality, there are lots of smart people out there who don’t have £8,000 lying around. Register your interest below and we'll let you know when we launch. You have greatness within you... Money should never be a barrier to achieving your dreams.
